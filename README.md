# importador_licitacoes_municipais_sagres
This is an importer that converts CSV data in to a relational database MySql for the open data about municipal biddings that are available in the follow link: http://tce.pb.gov.br/servicos/dados-abertos-do-sagres-tce-pb. The goal of that project is that civil society can get those data in a better way that allow them to make more efficient searchs rather than searching in a CSV file.
